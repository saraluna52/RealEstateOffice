### RealEstateOffice
Should a real estate business open a new office in Neighborhood A, NYC?

### üìå Project Summary
Using a dataset of 1,760,845 home sales in NYC between 2003 and 2021, I analyzed the financial and strategic potential of opening a new real estate office in Neighborhood A, a neighborhood in Brooklyn. I compared local market conditions to adjacent areas and the broader NYC market to forecast future sales activity and the expected profitability range of a new real estate office in Neighborhood A.

### üîç Methods & Tools
‚Ä¢ Exploratory Data Analysis: Trends in number of sales, home sizes, and prices

‚Ä¢ Comparative Market Analysis: 
      ‚Ä¢ t-tests to evaluate statistical differences across neighborhoods
      ‚Ä¢ k-means clustering to group similar market zones
  
‚Ä¢ Forecasting:
      ‚Ä¢ Time-series modeling for 2-year home sales prediction
      ‚Ä¢ Linear regression to estimate neighborhood growth
    
‚Ä¢ Optimization:
      ‚Ä¢ Excel Solver model to calculate NPV based on variable operating costs and forecasted sales volume ranges
         ‚Ä¢Included factors: office operating costs; staffing costs and commissions

### üìà Key Findings
‚Ä¢ Neighborhood A offers a high number of transactions but lower price per square foot compared to nearby markets closer to Manhattan.

‚Ä¢ The expected NPV over two years was just under $1M, but higher profits may be more easily attainable in other neighborhoods with rising property values.

‚Ä¢ Tradeoff identified: More effort (higher sales volume) required for comparable profits due to lower margins. 

### üíº Business Recommendation
While opening an office in Neighborhood A is financially viable, alternative locations may offer a better return with less intensive sales effort. This analysis suggests a need to balance overhead minimization with market growth potential.
